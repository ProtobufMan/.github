Welcome to the Bufman Community! ðŸ‘‹

Mainly composed of a CLI tool and a centralized open-source management system, Bufman is the first and only open-source system for working with Protocol Buffers. Bufman aims to provide the easiest way to work with Protobuf by managing all your Protobuf asserts, including not just your .proto files but also remote plugins. 

Bufman can be especially helpful if you are building microservices with frameworks like gRPC, go-micro, or Apache Dubbo.
